Currently I am sixteen years old and I am doing an apprenticeship as a software Engineer. I am specialised in Web Development. Mostly Angular and Bootstrap 5 including HTML, CSS and Javascript/Typescript.
I love to create new Things, which haven't existed before. I like to communication with our costumers to give them the best Software possible.

I hope I'll hear from you soon!
